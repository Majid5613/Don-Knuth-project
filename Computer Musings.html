<hr>
<p>I occasionally give lectures at Stanford during the academic year. These lectures are open to the public as well as to students and faculty. No tuition is charged, no attendance is taken, no credit is given. Each talk is independent of the others, and pitched at an audience of non-specialists. Sometimes I talk about difficult technical issues, but I try to minimize the jargon and complications by stressing the motivation and the paradigms and the high-level picture, without sweeping the details entirely under the rug.</p>
<p>The next talk in the series will take place next year.</p>
<h1>Musings Online</h1>
<p>Great news! Videotapes were made of many past lectures in this series, and the Stanford Center for Professional Development has for many years made them freely available as part of the "stanfordonline" channel on YouTube. You can find them on their website; or you can use the following convenient playlists that they've prepared, showing all of the videos in the collection:</p>
<dl>
  <dt>The Christmas Lectures</dt>
  <dd>(twenty videos)</dd>
  <dt>Other Computer Musings</dt>
  <dd>(thirty-six videos)</dd>
  <dt>The "Aha" Sessions (Stanford's "classic" problem solving course CS204, as it was captured in 1985)</dt>
  <dd>(twenty-two videos)</dd>

<p>Here is a reverse-chronological list of all previous lectures in the series. If I subsequently wrote a related paper on the topic, the number of that paper in my list of publications is given in brackets. Links to downloadable source files are also shown when the sources are available. Lectures available online are marked with "***".</p>
